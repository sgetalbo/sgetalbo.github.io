I've just started writing up my Geographic Data Science PhD, which means I'm back out in the big wide world and looking for work! I live in Oldham in Greater Manchester and work remotely from my back bedroom, often with the dog by my side. 

My skills include :
 - R coding
 - Data Analysis
 - Cluster analysis and segmentation
 - Spatial analysis
 
I currently work with several companies and start-ups providing a bespoke data service to help them meet theirs and their clients needs. 
 
I am also actively involved in the Manchester and Wider North West tech scene, organising R-Ladies Manchester events and working with Women in Data as their North West representative.
